(Note: This quest has no auto path finding)

After investigating, either a boss or quiz question will appear.

If boss, you and other players can kill the boss to get additional drop rewards. (Not sure if this include on the daily event-material capped)

– Follow the phases in this guide to earn score effectively.

Aim to get 50,000 Points to get the full rewards (This score is doubled when the boss is defeated making it 100,000 Points):

There is no limit of entering the instance, you can try many times if you fail to get higher score.

These tickets can be obtained for free on Ultraman Instance and you will have enough coins to purchase the 90 tickets on the Ultraman exchange NPC. Just make sure the set of pool rewards on the Normal Gacha is the one you like (Reroll if you don’t like it).

There are two types of gacha, the Normal Gacha and Suprise Attack Gacha.

The Normal Gacha, only has 90 prize pool, meaning you only need 90 Tickets to get all of the rewards including the A, B and SP Rewards.

For the Surprise Attack Gacha, there are 321 prize pool and it is shared for everyone in the server. Only the first 6 lucky winner will get the highlight rewards, when it is already sold out there is no point of drawing. You have to wait for the next refresh to participate.
